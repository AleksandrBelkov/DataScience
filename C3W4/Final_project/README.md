## Getting and Cleaning Data Course project

### The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

## Getting Started

### Data for this project are accessible at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
### Description of Data Set Characterisitcs is presented at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 
### Download and unzip files into subfolder "UCI HAR Dataset" of working directory.
### The dplyr package is necessary for the script.	

## Data set information

### The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

###The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 


## Attribute information

### For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
### - Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
### - Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
### - A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
### - Its activity label. 
### - An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
